# design-patterns-in-tcl
A collection of popular design patterns implemented in TCL language with TclOO package

### Collection contains :
- Abstract factory - Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- Bridge - Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.   
- Builder - Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
- Chain of responsibility - More than one object has chance to handle request.
- Command - Request as object to log requests, expand API by unavailable methods.
- Composite - Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- Decorator - Extend method functionality without changing method.
- Facade (TBD)
- Flyweight (TBD)
- Interpreter - Define representation for some grammar.
- Iterator
- Mediator - Simplifing communication between objects.
- Memento - Store internal object state and restore on request.
- Observer - Notify all registered objects about changes.
- Singleton - Only one instance of this kind of object possible.
- State - Object state as a class - an object oriented state machine.
- Strategy - Different algorithms which can be used interchangeably.
- Visitor - Different algorithms which can be used interchangeably.

### Theory and additional meterials
Design patterns implemented according to the tips and documentation available on the [sourcemaking.com](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns) webpage and in the [Design Patterns: Elements Of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B000SEIBB8&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_HaFbAbXCYNF0Z) book
